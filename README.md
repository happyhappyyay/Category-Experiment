A replication of my master's thesis experiment using React.js. This is an experiment exploring category learning, utilizing differing amounts of feedback (0%, 25%, 50%, 100%) and differing types of feedback (true, false, random). Results of the experiment are displayed upon experiment conclusion and no data is recorded.
